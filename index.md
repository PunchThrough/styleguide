## Styleguide styleguide

* Always place a table of contents at the top of the styleguide.

* Each section should start with an second-level header (`##`).

* Each rule should be a list item `*` in an un-ordered list.

* Indent code block examples 4 spaces to make them fall inside the list item.

* All code block examples should have code-level comments marking good/bad examples.

* When referencing methods/operators in the rule description, escape like `this`.


## How to use this styleguide in pull requests

Hovering over a styleguide rule should bring up the <i class="icon-map-marker"></i> icon.
Click this icon to set the page url to the section you want to quote.

Copy the url and paste it in a line-level comment on the offending pull request.
