* Each section should start with a second-level header (`##`). Tables of contents will be generated automatically from each section's headers.

* Use three backticks (<code>```</code>) to begin and end code blocks.

* Add language names to the start of code blocks (<code>```objc</code>) to enable syntax highlighting.

* All code block examples should have code-level comments marking good/bad examples as **Preferred** or **Not Preferred**.

* When referencing methods/operators in the rule description, escape with backticks (<code>\`</code>) like `this`.
